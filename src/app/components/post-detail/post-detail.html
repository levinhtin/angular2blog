        <p>Writing in markdown is really easy. In the left hand panel of Ghost, you simply write as you normally would. Where
          appropriate, you can use <em>formatting</em> shortcuts to style your content. For example, a list:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Item number one</li>
          <li>Item number two
            <ul>
              <li>A nested item</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A final item</li>
        </ul>

        <p>or with numbers!</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Remember to buy some milk </li>
          <li>Drink the milk </li>
          <li>Tweet that I remembered to buy the milk, and drank it</li>
        </ol>

        <h3 id="links">Links</h3>

        <p>Want to link to a source? No problem. If you paste in url, like <a href="http://ghost.org/">http://ghost.org</a>          - it'll automatically be linked up. But if you want to customise your anchor text, you can do that too! Here's
          a link to <a href="http://ghost.org/">the Ghost website</a>. Neat.</p>

        <h3 id="whataboutimages">What about Images?</h3>

        <p>Images work too! Already know the URL of the image you want to include in your article? Simply paste it in like this
          to make it show up:</p>

        <p><img src="./Welcome to Ghost_files/ghost.png" alt="The Ghost Logo"></p>

        <p>Not sure which image you want to use yet? That's ok too. Leave yourself a descriptive placeholder and keep writing.
          Come back later and drag and drop the image in to upload:</p>

        <h3 id="quoting">Quoting</h3>

        <p>Sometimes a link isn't enough, you want to quote someone on what they've said. It was probably very wisdomous. Is
          wisdomous a word? Find out in a future release when we introduce spellcheck! For now - it's definitely a word.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Wisdomous - it's definitely a word.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3 id="workingwithcode">Working with Code</h3>

        <p>Got a streak of geek? We've got you covered there, too. You can write inline <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> blocks really
          easily with back ticks. Want to show off something more comprehensive? 4 spaces of indentation gets you there.</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint prettyprinted"><code><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">awesome</span><span class="pun">-</span><span class="pln">thing </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln">
    display</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> block</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln">
    width</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">100</span><span class="pun">%;</span><span class="pln">
</span><span class="pun">}</span></code></pre>

        <h3 id="readyforabreak">Ready for a Break?</h3>

        <p>Throw 3 or more dashes down on any new line and you've got yourself a fancy new divider. Aw yeah.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="advancedusage">Advanced Usage</h3>

        <p>There's one fantastic secret about Markdown. If you want, you can write plain old HTML and it'll still work! Very
          flexible.
        </p>

        <p><input type="text" placeholder="I&#39;m an input field!"></p>

        <p>That should be enough to get you started. Have fun - and let us know what you think :)</p>
